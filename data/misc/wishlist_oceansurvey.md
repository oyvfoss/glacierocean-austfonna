# Wishlist, ocean survey

- Repeat CTD transect.
- Water sampling in plume for sediment composition analysis.
- Yoyo sampling of a plume.

**Yoyo sampling of plume:**
If a midwater plume (localized intrusion visible in T/S/beam transmission) is
found in the inner part of the glacier, it would be of interest to get extended
CTD record from this plume in order to examine the TS-space shape in the
intrusion from more than a single profile. The T-S shape can say someting about
the freshwater content, and abut whether the plume is composed of a mixture of
ocean water and subglacially discharged surface/bottom meltwater (distribution
along ambient to (0, 0)) or of ocean water and meltwater from ocean-forced
melting at the terminus (distrimution along "Gade lines").

Proposed sampling scheme:

- Station as close to the terminus as possible.
- Monitor profiles closely during downcast.
- If a plume/intrusion is identified: define a depth interval at least 10 m off either side of the intrustion as the "plume range".
- On the upcast: perform intensive "yoyo" sampling of this depth range - moving the CTD up and down within the plume range for as many cycles as possible. Ideally keep doing this for ~1 hour, meanwhile monitoring the CTD data and expanding the range if the plume seems to evolve.
