An overview of relevant papers (not clear what has been done here previously).

**Dowdeswell et al 2015:**
*Sediment-rich meltwater plumes and ice-proximal fans at the
margins of modern and ancient tidewater glaciers:
Observations and modelling*

 *Sedimentology* (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/sed.12198)

Detailed study of sediment plumes from the Nordaustlandet margin, including Hartogbukta. Based on satellite imagery, geophysical data and modelling - no ocean observations. 

Use the *SedPlume* model to look at sediment transport. As far as I can tell, the plume part of this is the Morton 1956 buoyant plume (half-cone, probably), but with no melting. They don't seem to specify where they get the stratification from.
