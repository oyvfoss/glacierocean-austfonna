*Sediment-rich meltwater plumes and ice-proximal fans at the
margins of modern and ancient tidewater glaciers:
Observations and modelling*

 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/sed.12198 - *Sedimentology* 

Detailed study of sediment plumes from the Nordaustlandet margin, including Hartogbukta. Based on satellite imagery, geophysical data and modelling - no ocean observations. 

Use the *SedPlume* model to look at sediment transport. As far as I can tell, the plume part of this is the Morton 1956 buoyant plume (half-cone, probably), but with no melting. They don't seem to specify where they get the stratification from.

Show detailed bathymetry from Hartogbukta - looks like there is an opening to about 100 m.
