# 1D plume model

We use buoyant plume theory (Morton 1956) with glacier-ocean fluxes (Jenkins et
al 2011) - integrating the plume conservation equations numerically from the
point of discharge upwards along the glacier face, and calculating ice-ocean and
entrainment fluxes along the way.

Everything in here is exploratory and nothing has been checked particularly rigourously..

  model](test_experiments/plume_test_experiments.md).
