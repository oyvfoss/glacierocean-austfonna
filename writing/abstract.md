### Abstract

The Northern Barents Sea  has experienced
the fastest rates of surface air warming and sea ice loss in the entire Arctic
Ocean during past decades. Ocean temperatures have also increased substantially
since the middle of the 2000s, and recent work suggests that glaciers along the Barents Sea margin of Svalbard
have lost mass during the same period. 
Here, we investigate the drivers of intraseasonal variations in the advance and
retreat of glacier front
position along the eastern margin of Austfonna observed from satellite imagery. We examine ocean temperature
from ocean mooring data along with other environmental variables including air
temperature, sea surface temperature and modelled glacier runoff. We find a
seasonal retreat of deep glacier fronts along eastern Austfonna to occur in late
autumn to early winter - out of phase with the seasonal surface and runoff
forcing, but  coincident with the seasonal inflow of Atlantic Water from the boundary current running north of
Svalbard. Lastly, we explore the system in a simple  line plume
model often used to study ocean-glacier interactions. The results suggest that
the seasonal ocean warming from Atlantic Water may explain the increased melt
rates in late autumn and winter. An indealised exploration of the parameter
space using the plume model suggests that frontal ablation rates of Austfonna
tidewater glacier margins are sensitive to ambient ocean temperature and
stratification, with melt rates varying by as much as an order of magnitude
within the observed range. The implication is that the transport of Atlantic
Water has a strong impact on frontal melt rates, with implication for glacier mass balance and for the
biogeochemical coastal ocean environment.
